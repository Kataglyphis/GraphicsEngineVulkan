.. The Exhale-generated API tree. The card above links to it, but a card is not
   a toctree: without this entry Sphinx warns "document isn't included in any
   toctree" for api/library_root, which -W turns into a failed build. Hidden:
   the card is the entry point; this only gives the generated pages a parent.
